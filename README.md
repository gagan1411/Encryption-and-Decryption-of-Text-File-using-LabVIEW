# Encryption-and-Decryption-of-Text-File-using-LabVIEW

Data encryption is employed to provide security to confidential data which thereby denies any unauthorized access. In this project, an efficient design is implemented to encrypt any text file and decrypt it using FFT and IFFT algorithms respectively. The design is implemented in LabVIEW software. The basic operations include
encryption in encryptor module, transmission through a communication medium to the decryptor module and the retrieval of original text file at the output of decryptor module.

The characters of the data file is extracted and converted into ASCII codes. This is then subjected to FFT algorithm to obtain an encrypted file and is ready to be transmitted. The encrypted text file is received as input at decryptor module and decrypted using IFFT algorithm.  The software used is LabVIEW.

Information security is one of the growing concern in various fields like nation security, defence, banking and protection of various confidential data. Encryption of text files is also important before sharing the file over a public channel such as the Internet where anyone can get access to our file and data.
